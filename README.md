# LLM-based-Text-Analysis
The LLM model effectively summarizes the survey responses by identifying key themes and patterns in user feedback. It extracts sentiments, recurring concerns, and decision-making trends from qualitative responses, providing a structured understanding of how individuals approach budgeting. 

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview  
This project uses NLP techniques to analyze survey responses related to budgeting habits, financial decision-making, and emotional responses toward budgeting. The goal is to extract meaningful insights and visualize key themes from the data.  

## ðŸš€ Features  
- **Text Processing & Cleaning**: Tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization  
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Understanding user emotions towards budgeting  
- **Topic Modeling**: Identifying recurring themes in responses  
- **Data Visualization**: Summarizing insights with graphs and dashboards  
- **LLM-based Summarization**: Extracting concise key takeaways from responses  

## ðŸ“Š Dataset  
The dataset consists of responses to survey questions covering:  
- Budgeting status (whether users budget or not)  
- Emotional responses toward budgeting  
- Reasons for budgeting or avoiding budgeting  
- Decision-making approaches  
- Reactions to exceeding budgets  

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack  
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, SpaCy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **NLP Models**: OpenAIâ€™s GPT (or other LLMs) for summarization  
- **Visualization**: Tableau / Matplotlib / Seaborn


## ðŸ“ˆ Results  
The analysis reveals key insights about budgeting behavior, emotions, and financial decision-making. The findings are visualized in an interactive dashboard to help users and researchers better understand financial habits.
